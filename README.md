# Java DSA Solutions 🚀

This repository contains my **topic-wise practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java**.  
I am solving questions step by step to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** and prepare for **coding interviews**.

The solutions are organized by **topics** such as Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and more.  
Each topic has multiple Java programs with **clean code, comments, and explanations** where necessary.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

You can run the programs in **two ways**:

### 1. Using Command Line (javac/java)
```bash
# Navigate to the topic folder
cd arrays

# Compile the Java file
javac TwoSum.java

# Run the compiled program
java TwoSum
```
2. Using an IDE (Recommended)

Import the repo into IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse as a Java project.

Navigate to the specific topic folder.

Right-click the file you want to run → Run as Java Application.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Strengthen core DSA concepts with Java.

Build a structured reference for interview preparation.

Showcase clean, well-structured, and working solutions on GitHub.
